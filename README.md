# FindersFilter

A [dalamud](https://github.com/goatcorp/Dalamud) plugin to filter the party finder based on current party makeup.

Functional, but in a very early stage of development (and likely to stay that way for the time being).

## Commands

```
/ffilter
```

## UI

The plugin adds a checkbox in the header of the party finder window.
Check it to enable filtering.
You must manually refresh the listings, however, before filters take effect.
